So point one could be the Sun as the central star. Then planets, but I should list them. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Wait, Pluto is no longer considered a planet, so maybe mention that. Next, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune. Also, the Oort Cloud. Oh, but the user wants five points, so I need to be concise. Maybe structure it as: 1. Sun at center, 2. Eight planets, 3. Asteroid belt, 4. Kuiper Belt, 5. Oort Cloud. That's five. Let me check if that's accurate. Yes, Pluto was demoted, but the user might not know that. Maybe mention it as a dwarf planet.
